/*
 Pay special attention to this constructor in BoxWeight:

 boxweight1(boixweight1 obj){
     super(ob);
     weight = ob.weight;
 }

Notice that super( ) is passed an object of type BoxWeightâ€”not of type Box.
This still invokes the constructor Box(Box ob). As mentioned earlier, a superclass
variable can be used to reference any object derived from that class. Thus, we are
able to pass a BoxWeight object to the Box constructor. Of course, Box only has
knowledge of its own members.
