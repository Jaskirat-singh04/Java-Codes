/*
Here, weightbox is a reference to BoxWeight objects, and plainbox is a reference to
inhjeritance2 objects. Since BoxWeight is a subclass of inheritance2, it is permissible to assign
plainbox a reference to the weightbox object.when a reference to a subclass object is assigned to a superclass reference
variable, you will have access only to those parts of the object defined by the
superclass. This is why plainbox canâ€™t access weight even when it refers to a
BoxWeight object. superclass
has no knowledge of what a subclass adds to it. This is why the last line of code in
the preceding fragment is commented out. It is not possible for a inheritance2 reference to
access the weight field, because inheritance2 does not define one.
